## What I Learned
- To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to create a database to add and view employees and assign ids, roles, salaries, departments, managers, and department utilized budget. The application prompts the user to select an employee or department, a function to be completed i.e. add, remove, or update , and saves the database in a table format.
